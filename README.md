# Analysis of COVID19 data
----
# Problem statement

COVID19 was a major blow for global economy and the world as a whole is yet to fully recover hence I deemed it interesting to analyze it

----
# Data Sourcing

The data was made available on

----
# Data Cleaning

The data HAD TO be cleaned as it was in wide format initially and many other changes had to be made as the datasets were imported one by one however this was relatively easy as the process was only done for the confirmed dataset. This dataset was then duplicated and the file source was changed, hence the changes made were simply repeated for the rest of the datasets
Next I merged the 3 datasets i needed to get just one dataset that comprised of all the information they had. Another challenge I had was when I had to change the values of my date from text to date and most of them were giving an error. This occured because the date format conflicteed. I had to change it by going to 'text to columns' and then i clicked enter twice and changed the date format. After I was sure that the all the datatypes had been changed to their appropriate values it was ready for visualization
